\def\Abstract{%
Both dependent types and linear types have their desirable properties.
Department types can express functional dependencies of inputs and outputs,
while linear types offer control over the~use of computational resources.
Combining these two systems have been difficult because of their different
interpretations of context presence of variables. Quantitative Type Theory (QTT)
combines dependent types and linear types by using a~semiring to track the~kind
of use of every resource. We extend QTT with the~additive pair and additive unit
types, express the complete QTT rules in bidirectional form, and then present
our interpreter of a~simple language based on QTT.
